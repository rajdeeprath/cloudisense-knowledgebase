# LLM Integration Plan for CloudiSENSE

This document outlines a step-by-step strategy to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into CloudiSENSE, transforming it into an AI-powered DevOps assistant that understands and executes natural language queries.

---

## üëÅÔ∏è Goal
Enable operators to chat with CloudiSENSE and:
- Trigger actions
- Provision infrastructure
- Observe metrics
- Run diagnostics

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core LLM Bridge (`llmcore` Module)
**Objective:** Build a pluggable module to communicate with OpenAI, Claude, or local LLMs.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1.1 | Create `llmcore` module in CloudiSENSE |
| 1.2 | Add support for OpenAI, Claude APIs, and optional local LLMs |
| 1.3 | Define `intent_chat_llm` intent with `prompt`, `context`, `params` |
| 1.4 | Stream responses using WebSocket or PubSub integration |

---

## üßπ Phase 2: Agentic Skill Mapping
**Objective:** Map user language to system intents.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 2.1 | Describe system intents as few-shot examples |
| 2.2 | Build a Planner that maps user requests to intent + params |
| 2.3 | Optionally integrate LangChain AgentExecutor or custom planner |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Command Execution via RPC
**Objective:** Let the LLM initiate RPCs internally.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 3.1 | After intent mapping, synthesize a CloudiSENSE RPC message |
| 3.2 | Call `MessageRouter.handle_messages()` as if it were a browser |
| 3.3 | Relay results back to user via dashboard/chat interface |

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Phase 4: Multi-Step Planning & Chains
**Objective:** Execute sequences of actions.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 4.1 | LLM decomposes complex queries into subtasks |
| 4.2 | Track memory/state between steps |
| 4.3 | Support an `intent_chain` RPC format |
| 4.4 | Optionally adopt ReAct (Reasoning + Action) or AutoGen-like patterns |

---

## üìä Phase 5: Observability & Feedback
**Objective:** Let LLM react to metrics/logs/alerts.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 5.1 | Feed system context (metrics, logs) into prompt |
| 5.2 | LLM suggests actions: restart, notify, scale, etc. |
| 5.3 | Add user confirmation flow ("Should I continue?") |

---

## ü§ñ Bonus Phase: Autonomous Cloud Agent
**Objective:** Allow LLMs to operate autonomously within guardrails.

| Idea | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Agent Identity | Each node is a chat-capable AI agent |
| Policy Engine | Governs allowed actions (restart=yes, delete=no) |
| Escalation | Falls back to human if confidence is low |
| ChatOps | Logs and communicates via chat UI in dashboard |

---

## Tech Stack
- **LLM APIs**: OpenAI, Claude, or local models
- **LangChain** (optional)
- **CloudiSENSE Pub/Sub + RPC**
- **Tornado WebSocket for streaming responses**

---

## Next Steps
Start implementation of `llmcore` module:
- Define intent: `intent_chat_llm`
- Use `openai.ChatCompletion` or Claude
- Support single-shot & streaming
- Add to MessageRouter
