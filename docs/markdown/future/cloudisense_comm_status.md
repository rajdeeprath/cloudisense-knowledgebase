## Next Recommended Step

Design and implement:

- **Remote ‚Üí Browser Event Relay**
  - When a remote CloudiSENSE instance publishes to a topic:
    - Local instance (which browser is connected to) must receive that event
    - Forward it to all subscribed WebSocket clients

This will enable full **remote streaming support** to browser-based dashboards.
